## Methodoly (to be confirmed)

-Every include, struct declarations, constant declarations and function declarations in header file "shell.h".

-Use of lower camel case (ex: lowerCamelCase) for variables and functions names.

-Use of upper snake case (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE) for constants declaration and use.

-Functions that require error handling will be defined within "wrapper.c"

-Try to DEFINE constants in header files whenever it seems a appropriate, mainly to minimize errors and for readbility's sake. (To be confirmed)
