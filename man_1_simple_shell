.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIcommand\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsimple_shell\fR is a basic UNIX command line interpreter developed as part of Holberton's Simple Shell Project. It mimics core functionality of a Unix shell, supporting both built-in and external commands, user input handling, and process management. The shell reads user input, executes commands, and replicates some behaviors of standard UNIX shells.

The following operations are supported:
- Command parsing
- Built-in commands (e.g., `env`, `exit`)
- Execution of external commands
- Process creation and management using `fork()` and `execve()`

.SH OPTIONS
\fBsimple_shell\fR does not accept any command-line options.

.SH COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:

.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. The shell exits with an optional status code. If no status is specified, it exits with status 0. If a status is provided, the shell will exit with that code.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables. It outputs the environment variables currently set in the shell.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The shell relies on the following environment variable:

.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for executable files when running external commands.

.SH USAGE
To start the simple shell, compile the program with:

.B gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o simple_shell *.c

Then run the shell with:

.B ./simple_shell
